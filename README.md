# ACM AI Bird Classifier Project

**ACM AI Project FA21**

**Team Coleslaw**

The ultimate goal of this project was to develop a model that would be able to classify between different species of birds. We utilized a Kaggle dataset for this, which split the data into training, validation, and test sets for our use.

We started with the MNIST dataset due to its simplicity, and from there worked our way up to building a model for the bird classification problem. We built a CNN for this task, which required a lot of experimentation and research.
